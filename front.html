    Preparation for ESAM prelim
</h1>

<!-- paragraph -->
<p>
    This website contains the collective intellignece from some ESAM graduate student pioneers to facilitate the prelim preparation of the first year students. The purpose is to explain the previous prelim problems in a easy-to-understand and well-motivated manner. We type with a wish to guide the students to work through the problems by themselves rather than showing them our solutions. We would be very pleasant to see the students touch and sense the problems before reading the solutions.
    <!-- new solutions -->
    <!-- relevant background -->
    <!-- more interesting, e.g., calculus -->
    <br>
    It is also an attempt to take advantage of the interactivity of a website to provide progressive tutorials.
    <br>
    We hope you have fun.
